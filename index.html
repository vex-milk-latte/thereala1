            <p> <pre> 		Hey there, I'm Cass, a 17 year old student with both SLSS and SLC, 
            enrolled in the dual credit program. I work part time as well, and my spare time is
            mostly taken up by gaming and digital art. I graduate SLSS this semester, and hope
            to go somewhere else for college. </pre> </p>

<p> <font size = "2"> (these are just goofy things I and my friends have said about me because I dont actually have any testimonials but I needed to use q for something.) </font> </p>

	<q> Dude, you're awful at the game. You're actually bad! </q> - My friend once, while we were doing a FighterZ raid. <br> <br>

	<q> You're such a nerd, you're <strong> actually </strong> listening to a Dragon Ball opening on loop right now. I can't believe you. </q> - Me, to myself.
	
<!-- for the record, it was limit break x survivor which is really good -->
<!-- i had another day to work at this at lunch at SLSS and I can confirm im listening to limit break x survivor on loop again. -->
